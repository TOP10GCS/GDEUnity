🎤 Pitch Simulator

AI-Powered VR & Web Presentation Training Platform

Pitch Simulator is an AI-driven presentation training system designed to help students and professionals practice public speaking in realistic, interactive environments. Available as both a VR experience and web application, the platform bridges the gap between private rehearsal and real-world performance.

🚀 The Problem

Traditional presentation practice methods are ineffective:

Practicing in front of a mirror creates no real pressure

Friends and classmates don’t simulate realistic audience reactions

No unexpected questions

No objective performance feedback

As a result, 70–80% of students experience anxiety during real presentations.

💡 The Solution

Pitch Simulator creates immersive, AI-powered practice environments where:

🤖 AI-driven audiences react naturally

❓ Virtual participants ask dynamic, context-aware questions

📊 Real-time feedback analyzes performance metrics

🎯 Users receive actionable improvement suggestions

The platform transforms presentation training from a rare, high-stakes event into a daily, low-pressure habit.
